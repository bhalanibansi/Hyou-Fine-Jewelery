Lab-grown diamonds are crafted using two main techniques:<\/p><ol><li>High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT): This method mimics the intense heat and pressure conditions deep within the Earth’s mantle. Tiny diamond seeds are placed in a chamber where extreme conditions cause carbon to crystallize and form diamonds. Think of it as a high-tech pressure cooker for diamonds!<\/li><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD): In this method, a diamond seed is placed in a vacuum chamber filled with carbon-rich gasses.
